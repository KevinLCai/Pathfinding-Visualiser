# Pathfinding-Visualiser
Forest Fire Simulator using Pathfinding Algorithms

This project aims to explore how we can simulate the spread of fire using different search algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, A* search, Breadth-first-search and Depth-first-search.

Throughout the creation of this project, I have learnt about graph theory and implementing data structures such as stacks and queues. Additionally, I have learnt to implement different search algorithms, in particular Depth-first and Breadth-first search which have strong applications in other areas of programming.

I have learnt some of the basics of working with React, a framework I was previously unfamiliar with. In addition, I have increased my competancies in Javascript, while the majority of my programming experience is in using Python.
